🚀 Overview
This project builds a movie recommendation engine with Python. It analyzes movie metadata and user ratings to provide personalized recommendations. The system may incorporate:

Content-Based Filtering (similarity based on genres, plot, cast, crew, keywords)

Collaborative Filtering (user-user or item-item recommendations via matrix factorization using Surprise or Spark ML)

Hybrid Approaches combining both techniques for better accuracy

📁 Dataset
Uses MovieLens datasets:

Small (~100K ratings, thousands of users and movies)

Full (26M ratings, hundreds of thousands of movies and users)

Dataset files (e.g. movies.dat, ratings.dat) are converted to .csv and processed within Jupyter notebooks.

🧠 Model Approaches
Content-Based Filtering
Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for movie overviews and metadata (genres, cast).

Compute cosine similarity between movie feature vectors to recommend similar titles

.

Collaborative Filtering
Use Surprise library for algorithms like SVD, NMF, SVD++.

Train on user-item ratings to predict unseen preferences and rank recommendations.

Hybrid Recommendation (Optional)
Combine predicted ratings from collaborative filtering with content-based similarity to generate a ranked list of movie suggestions.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, Surprise)

Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and modeling

(Optional) Flask or Streamlit web interface for interactive demo

🧪 Sample Results
Example recommendations:

Input Movie	Recommended Movies
Toy Story (1995)	Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc
The Matrix (1999)	Inception, Blade Runner 2049
Jumanji (1995)	Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle

These results can improve as you add more user-rated samples or richer metadata.
